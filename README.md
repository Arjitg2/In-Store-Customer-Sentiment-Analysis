# Retail Vision: In-Store Customer Sentiment Analysis

### 📄 Project Summary
Retail Vision is a computer vision system designed for physical retail stores. It analyzes real-time video feeds to detect customer emotions (e.g., Happy, Neutral, Frustrated) without storing personal data. This helps store managers understand the "Quality of Visit" and improve customer service.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (Real-time face detection)
* **AI Model:** TensorFlow/Keras (CNN for Emotion Recognition)
* **Data:** NumPy, Pandas

### 👨‍💻 My Role (Lead AI Engineer)
This was a team project where I led the technical development. My contributions included:
1.  **Model Training:** Designed and trained the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the FER-2013 dataset.
2.  **Real-Time Pipeline:** Built the OpenCV logic to capture video and run inference in real-time.
3.  **System Integration:** integrated the backend logic with the data visualization dashboard.

### 🚀 Usage
This project processes video input frame-by-frame, locates faces, and overlays the predicted emotion label on the live feed.
